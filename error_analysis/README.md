We keep inputs for the error analysis tool in here. Use the amr-challenge-error-analysis branch of vulcan for this (https://github.com/jgroschwitz/vulcan/tree/amr-challenge-error-analysis).

The folder "visual_inspection" (if it exists on your version) contains pickle files to be used with the master branch of vulcan. It is just for looking at results, not for a formal error analysis.
