# the first column is AMR ID. second column is the word that is ambiguous (not needed for eval, but here as reference)
# The third column is how the word is represented in the gold graph: as a NODE or an EDGE
# If EDGE, the columns 4 and 6 are the nodes from and to which the edge goes, and column 5 is the edge label.
# If EDGE_PLUS, it's the same as EDGE, but the target of the edge is part of the evaluation too and not a prerequisite
# If NODE, column 4 is the node label and optionally column 6 is an edge label that can represent the concept instead
