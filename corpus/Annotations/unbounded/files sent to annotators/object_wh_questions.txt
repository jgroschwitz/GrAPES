*Special instructions*: Please follow AMR guidelines for which node is the source. Some have a function word marked as the head, but I suspect most of those aren't right for AMR. e.g. for the first one, the head is probably "stand" or "stand-for". If it makes sense to do so, please also report the dependency length accordingly. In the first example, that would be 5, not 6.
