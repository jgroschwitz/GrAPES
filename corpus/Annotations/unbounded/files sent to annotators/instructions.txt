These sentences are taken from a corpus with different kinds dof long-distance dependencies, like wh-questions and relative clauses. Each type has its own text file. The sentences were parsed by a syntactic dependency parser, so for each long-distance dependency there is a synctactic head, dependant, and label. 

Each item consists of 3 lines:

ID
sentence
[syntactic dependency label] [head and index] [dependent and index]

Now, obviously AMR is abstracted from the sentence, so things don't always line up exactly, but essentially we want the AMR equivalent of that third line.

Your job is to provide an AMR for the head and an AMR for the dependent, and the edge label that should go between them. Most of them will be single nodes, but when there is more than one node you don't need to specify which node the edge should come from or go to. (We'll actually be really lenient and allow any.)

Usually the head will be the source graph and the dependent will be the target graph, but sometimes AMR does it differently. (By "source" and "target" I mean source --edge-> target). You don't have to worry about which should be the root of the whole thing, i.e. no need for ":ARG1-of", just swap the order and use ":ARG1"

If you think there's more than one good way to annotate them (to the point that you're really not happy only allowing one) you can provide them all. Try to avoid this; in these cases it's usually better just to skip the sentence, but you can use your judgement.

You're provided with a sample TSV file with a bunch of annotated examples. To make your own, copy the top line into a new file. The columns are:

A. ID
B. sentence
C. Source subgraph(s), separated by a space if more than one option
D. Edge label including colon (:)
E. Target subgraph(s), separated by a space if more than one option
F. Dependency length (subtract the indices)
G. Dependency type (e.g. subj rel) -- just fill these down from the provided one, and if you do more categories you can make something up.
H. comments (optional)

Some additional notes:

- please make sure the source and target subgraphs don't have any overlapping node names

- We want about 15 of each category, but I've provided you with a few extra in case there are some that strike you as too weird or hard.

- Some categories have additional instructions at the top of the .txt file

- Some indices aren't right because I collapsed the contractions, e.g. is n't -> isn't, but I tried to adjust them so the distances at least were correct. You might want to check this.

- Some syntactic dependencies are different from the AMR dependencies, so just use the given head and dependent as a guide for what you're looking for. E.g. some have prepositions that probably shouldn't have AMR nodes in that sentence, so use the noun (or verb -- use your judgement) associated with the preposition as the subgraph of interest in those cases. Please adapt the dependency length to match if possible. 

- If you notice a dependency doesn't seem right (other than as above), make a note in the comments.

- Two dependencies in one sentence counts as two items. Please put them on two lines and just copy the ID and sentence.

- If there's more than one dependency in a sentence you can choose to use as many as you want, including none.

- I tried to fix the sentences to be AMR Bank compatable, but if you notice I missed anything, please fix it.
